# NBA_Project

My final project is focused on the analysis of the whole data about pro players in the NBA. The topic that I chose is based on my personal interest since basketball is one of my most favorite sport games; also, the NBA team was selected for the analysis as it is the most famous basketball team in the sports world. 

 Initially, I was aiming to investigate the effect of the players’ height, weight and their origin on their sport abilities and in-game effectiveness. However, then I realised that in the modern world money is the key factor in any field, whether it concerns sports or other spheres, therefore I decided to focus on the salaries of the players. Thus, my aim is to investigate the impact of the salary of a player on their performance during games and their effectiveness in achieving high points and trophies for their teams. Based on this factor, I decided to search for the information recorded in the past years about the salary of the players who have been playing in the NBA as a pro player for several years, also correlating their income to their level of performance during games. Therefore, my main research question is stated as:

To what extent does the salary of an NBA player affect their performance during the games?

Also, another factor that, I believe, should be considered is whether the position of the player on the court can affect their salary. For instance, the most known basketball players, such as Michael Jordan, James LeBron, Kobe Bryant, ets., are usually attackers and they take such positions as Small Forward (SF), Power Forward (PF) and Shooting Guard (SG) which are the attacking positions. Therefore, the next question which should be answered is:

How does a player’s position in the basketball game affect their salary?

Moreover, what I have noticed in the basketball world is that age might be another aspect which can influence the salary of a player. The fact is that the older the player is, the higher is their income. Thus, the question is:

To what extent is it true that the older and more experienced basketball players earn more than the new young players? If it is true, then why is it so?

It is also evident that the dollar price is rising each year so it would be pertinent to state the question:

Does the change of the dollar price affect the salary of the basketball players?

Lastly, it is known that the salaries of the NBA players are much higher than the income of an average individual, therefore my last question is:

Why are the salaries of the basketball players so high?
For the investigation I have found the dataset that was taken from Kaggle, the world’s largest data science community which provides access to many data sets, including the table which contains the whole information about the NBA players’ salaries in the period 2002 to 2017. The table presents information about the players’ names, teams, position and salary for the certain season, and the season itself. The information provided in the table also concerns the spending of money of a certain team on a player’s salary, seasons with the highest salaries, leading teams, the most paid positions and other details which allow me to answer all the stated above questions regarding the NBA players’ income.
